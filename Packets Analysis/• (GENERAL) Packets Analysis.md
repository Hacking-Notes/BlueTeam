<h2>Packets Analysis</h2>

Packets are the most basic unit of the network data transferred over the network. When a message is sent from one host to another, it is transmitted in small chunks; each called a packet. Packet analysis is the process of extracting, assessing and identifying network patterns such as connections, shares, commands and other network activities, like logins, and system failures, from the prerecorded traffic files.Â 


- Why Does Packet Analysis Still Matter?

Network traffic is a pure and rich data source. A Packet Capture (PCAP) of network events provides a rich data source for analysis. Capturing live data can be focused on traffic flow, which only provides statistics on the network traffic. On the other hand, identifying and investigating network patterns in-depth is done at the packet level. Consequently, threat detection and real-time performance troubleshooting cannot be done without packet analysis.

Today, most network-based detection mechanisms and notification systems ingest and parse packet-level information to create alerts and statistical data. Also, most red/blue/purple teaming exercises are optimised with packet-level analysis. Lastly, even encoded/encrypted network data still provides value by pointing to an odd, weird, or unexpected pattern or situation, highlighting that packet analysis still matters.
