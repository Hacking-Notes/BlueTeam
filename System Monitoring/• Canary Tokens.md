<h2>What is Canary Tokens and How to Use It?</h2>
Canary tokens are simple, yet effective, tools used for detecting unauthorized access or activity within networks or systems. Here's an overview of Canary tokens:
### Canary Token:
- A Canary token is essentially a piece of data or a file placed within a network or system, designed to act as a tripwire or early warning system when accessed or manipulated without authorization.
- It can take various forms, such as a file, URL, DNS record, or even a specific piece of text, and is deliberately placed in locations where unauthorized access or activity is suspected.
### Operation:
- Once a Canary token is deployed, any attempt to access, open, modify, or interact with it triggers an alert or notification, indicating potential unauthorized access or activity.
- Canary tokens are often used in conjunction with monitoring systems, security tools, or threat intelligence platforms to detect and respond to potential security incidents.
